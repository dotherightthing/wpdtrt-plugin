Boilerplate for WordPress plugin development.

## Installation

Please install and use via the [DTRT WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Generator](https://github.com/dotherightthing/generator-wp-plugin-boilerplate). Note that the generator does not generate *this* boilerplate, but rather scaffolds out a new plugin which piggybacks on the functionality packaged in *this* boilerplate.

## Usage

Please start by reading the wiki section titled [Workflows](https://github.com/dotherightthing/wpdtrt-plugin-boilerplate/wiki/Workflows).

## Note

This library uses wpdtrt-npm-scripts, but a release zip archive is not generated as the library is only consumed as a Composer dependency.
