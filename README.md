# DTRT Plugin Boilerplate

Base classes for a WordPress plugin and associated shortcodes and widgets.

## Demo usage

TODO.

(`wpdtrt-attachment-map` uses this but is a private repository).

## History

This is an evolution of several other approaches:

### [generator-wp-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/dotherightthing)

* generates a WordPress plugin from a Yeoman template
* difficult to track evolving changes to boilerplate code

### wpdtrt

* WordPress parent theme
* bundles common functionality
* functionality too tightly coupled

### 3rd party class

* someone else's code
* not intuitive
